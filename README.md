# Persuasion Dialog Dataset

We designed an online persuasion task to collect emerging persuasion strategies from human-human conversations on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform (1000 completed conversations were collected). In this task, the persuader persuaded the persuadee to donate the task earning to the charity. To maximize the persuader's motivation in improving his/her persuasive skills, we told the persuader that he/she would be awarded with half of whatever the amount the persuadee donates. 

Each participant was required to complete at least 10 conversational turns. The participants were encouraged to continue the conversation until an agreement was reached.
